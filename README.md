# use after free() (c): how to exploit a flaw in glibc's heap management.

### what is heap?
your computer has storage (in this case, random access memory) which is always available for use by C executables. 
any given program starts at a location in that 'storage', and the stack specific to that program grows from that location onwards. 
the stack is fast to access, but it's only around 8 MB of space. in comparison, the heap is for dynamically allocated memory,
which can be much larger than 8 megabytes. as a downside, it's slightly slower to access (and you have to free the allocated memory manually)
